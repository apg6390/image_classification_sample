# image_classification_sample
An image classification sample with tensorflow coded using ChatGpt


**Input Prompts for ChatGPT**

1) Write Python code of a neural network to solve the MNIST problem using Keras using fully connected layers and categorical crossentropy as the loss function without evaluating the model on the test set

2) Change the loss function to be sparse categorical crossentropy

3) now please use convolutional layers

4) ValueError: Shapes (None, 1) and (None, 10) are incompatible - fix that

5) Evaluate the model using its test set. Use 20% of the training set as a validation set.

6) plot the training and test loss using matplotlib. plot 20 random images with label from the training set and see if the model predicts the images correct by color coding wrong predictions with red and right predictions with green.


**Output**
Test loss: 0.04220328852534294, Test accuracy: 0.9896000027656555
